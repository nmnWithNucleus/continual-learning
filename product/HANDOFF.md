# HANDOFF — founders' working canvas (whole company)

> The single touch-point for the founders (CTO + AI co-founder) and the top of the
> escalation path. Read this first in any founders' session, then the aspect file you're
> working ([handoff/](handoff/)). Stable docs: [VISION.md](VISION.md) ·
> [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) · [ORG.md](ORG.md) · [PROMPTS.md](PROMPTS.md).
> Service-level state lives in each service's own HANDOFF.md — this board links, not restates.

## Founders' aspect threads

| Aspect | File | State |
|---|---|---|
| Engineering | [handoff/engineering.md](handoff/engineering.md) | active — **serve-loop MVP (v0.0) built + mock loop runs E2E** (integrator, 2026-07-09); real vLLM path scripted-but-unrun |
| Research | [handoff/research.md](handoff/research.md) | seeded — first agenda: POC→continuum bridge, research agenda v1 |

| Hiring / Ops | [handoff/hiring-ops.md](handoff/hiring-ops.md) | seeded |

## Escalations (open items needing a founders' decision)

*None open.* Resolved items move to the Decisions log below.

## Decisions log (founders)

| # | Decision | Date | Recorded in |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | **Platform is a ratified service** (ninth node: infra/CI/security/privacy/cost). CTO to read the internals in detail later; scope accepted as-is | 2026-07-09 | [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) component table; this board |
| D2 | **Single-markdown doc protocol** — one stable CHARTER + one volatile HANDOFF per node; no parallel human/AI copies | 2026-07-09 | [ORG.md](ORG.md) §Documentation protocol |
| D3 | **Serve-loop first** — build the thin end-to-end backbone (input → QueryBuilder → inference on base model → output), then grow capture/storage/continuum around it | 2026-07-09 | [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) §Decisions; [handoff/engineering.md](handoff/engineering.md) |
| D4 | **Wearable is camera + mic only (no speaker)** — market bodycams lack speakers; drop the speaker requirement from the hardware pick | 2026-07-09 | [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) §Ownership splits; recording + output charters |
| D5 | **Mobile app ships in v0** as an interaction surface **and** the default speech-output sink (mobile → Bluetooth headphones/earbuds). Only mobile *screen capture* stays deferred | 2026-07-09 | [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) §Ownership splits + §Decisions; input + output charters |
| D6 | **Base model = Qwen3-VL-32B** (re-verify OCR on our own screen-capture data before locking) | 2026-07-09 | [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) §Decisions |
| D7 | **POCs are reference, not source** — production code is written fresh; POCs inform contracts/learnings only, no lift-and-shift | 2026-07-09 | [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) §Decisions; [ORG.md](ORG.md) §Conventions |
| D8 | **OCR decoupled from the BWM** — a specialist OCR-strong VLM transcribes on-screen text (+ frame location) in the data-processing pipeline; the text is woven into the description target, so BWM OCR quality never gates the product (retires the D6 caveat) | 2026-07-09 | [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) §Decisions; [data-processing charter](services/data-processing/CHARTER.md) |

## Current state (terse)

- 2026-07-08: `product/` structure stood up — vision/architecture/org/prompts written,
  all 8 services chartered with seeded canvases, contracts **C1–C11** pinned in
  [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). A two-critic review pass (seam consistency + narrative
  coverage, 22 findings) drove: three new contracts minted (C9 response stream, C10
  training-window read, C11 recent-context read), an §Ownership splits section deciding the
  contested seams (wearable device, deletion, consent, BWM custody, people registry,
  same-day context, `/raw` custody), and per-charter amendments. No implementation started
  anywhere. POCs (`poc/live_stream_stability`, `poc/recursive_finetuning_stability`,
  `poc/live_video_chat`) continue as continuum/inference research feeders.

- 2026-07-09: all five founding escalations resolved (Decisions log D1–D8). Device/output
  narrative reworked for no-speaker wearable + mobile-as-speech-sink; mobile app pulled into
  v0 scope; build order locked to serve-loop-first; BWM set to Qwen3-VL-32B with OCR decoupled
  into a data-processing specialist pass (D8). Serve-loop MVP slice (v0.0) drafted in the
  engineering thread. `product/` tree committed to git.

- 2026-07-09 (later): interface-freeze done (C3/C9/C4/C6 v0 locked in
  [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) §Contracts + [contracts/](contracts/)); WS A–E built their
  services; **integrator wired them and ran the mock loop end to end.** A turn typed at the
  computer surface (`:8081`) streams a base-*mock* answer in the C9 format and the C4 turn is
  persisted + re-readable by `session_id`/`turn_id`; C6 resolves to base. All suites green
  (storage 10 · inference 6 · input 19 · output 46 = **81 passed**). Deltas: output's
  `c9_reader.js` wired into the input surface; inference `run.sh` honors `HOST`/`PORT`; storage
  test-DB gitignored. **Real Qwen3-VL-32B (`vllm`) is scripted-but-unrun** (needs the a3mega
  node). Full result: [handoff/engineering.md](handoff/engineering.md) "Serve-loop MVP — v0.0
  build result"; run guide: [services/README.md](services/README.md). **Not yet committed** —
  the founders' session commits.

## Next

- **Flip mock → real base model:** on the a3mega node run
  [`services/inference/serve_vllm.sh`](services/inference/serve_vllm.sh) (Qwen3-VL-32B, TP=8),
  set `MODEL_BACKEND=vllm`, `run_all.sh --restart`, and confirm a real streamed answer — the
  one remaining step to the true v0.0 exit criterion.
- Commit the serve-loop MVP build (founders' session).
- Then the next slice off the walking skeleton (capture / continuum / personalization) — pick
  in the engineering thread. CTO to read the Platform charter internals when time allows (D1).
