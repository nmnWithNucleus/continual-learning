"""The neutral shapes every modality plugin speaks — the load-bearing seam.

A ``Processor`` turns one validated C1 envelope + its raw blob bytes into a LIST
of ``ProcessedUnit`` (>= 1). The core assembles a C2 record per unit, so:

  * audio / image / text  -> a single-element list (1 chunk -> 1 record);
  * video                 -> many units (1 chunk -> many keyframe records),
                             each tagged with a ``discriminator`` (keyframe index)
                             so its ``record_id`` is stable AND distinct.

``ProcessedContent`` mirrors exactly the frozen C2 ``content`` object
(kind|text|language?|segments?) — the Processor emits content already in C2 shape
(segments carry ABSOLUTE RFC3339 times), so the core never has to know a modality's
timing/segment semantics. ``content.kind`` is one of the frozen C2 enum values:
``transcript`` (audio) | ``caption`` (image/video) | ``ocr`` | ``text``.

``enrichments`` is present-but-empty in v0 (mirrors C4's empty trace arrays) so
diarization / world-data enrichment never change the C2 shape.

``process`` is a PLAIN (blocking) method: the core runs it in a threadpool, so a
Processor may do heavy CPU/GPU work (ASR today, VLM captioning later) without
blocking the event loop.
